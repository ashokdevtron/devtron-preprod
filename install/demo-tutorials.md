#### Next Recommended Action

When you install Devtron for the first time, it creates a default admin user and password (with unrestricted access to Devtron). You can use it to log in as an administrator.

After the initial login, we recommend you set up any [Single Sign-On (SSO)](../global-configurations/authorization/sso-login/) service like Google, GitHub, etc., and then add other users (including yourself). Subsequently, all the users can use the same SSO (e.g., GitHub) to log in to the Dashboard.
