# Create Your Plugin

## Introduction

Devtron lets you create plugins to run specific tasks at different stages of your CI/CD pipelines. You can create any of the following:

* CI plugin (in pre-build/post-build stage)
* CD plugin (in pre-deployment/post-deployment stage) ...or both.

You can achieve this by converting a fully functional custom task into a plugin. Creating a plugin makes it reusable with other CI or CD pipelines.

***

## Plugin Creation

There are two parts to creating a plugin:

1. [Create a Custom Task](create-plugin.md#part-1-create-a-custom-task)
2. [Convert Custom Task to a Plugin](create-plugin.md#part-2-convert-custom-task-to-a-plugin)

### Part 1: Create a Custom Task

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Who Can Perform This Action?

Only superadmins can create plugins.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Prerequisite

A build or deployment pipeline must exist in the **Workflow Editor** of your app.
{% endhint %}

In the following example, we are creating a plugin named 'Secret Management Validator'.

1.  Go to **Applications** and select your app from the **Devtron Apps** tab.

    ![Figure 1: Choosing your App](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/select-devtron-app.jpg)
2.  From the **Configurations** tab, go to **Workflow Editor**.

    ![Figure 2: Workflow Editor](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/workflow-editor.jpg)
3.  Click any pipeline (build/deployment pipeline).

    ![Figure 3: Selecting Pipeline](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/select-pipeline.jpg)
4.  Go to the **Pre** or **Post** stage of your pipeline, e.g., `Pre-build stage`.

    ![Figure 4: Selecting Stage](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/pre-build-stage.jpg)
5.  Click **+ Add Task** to create a plugin from scratch or click an existing task.

    ![Figure 5: Adding a Task](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/execute-custom-task.jpg)
6.  On the **Execute Custom Task** page, fill the following details:

    * **Task Name** - Give a name to the task, e.g., `Secret Management Validator Task`.
    * **Description** - Write the purpose of the task in brief.
    * **Task Type** - Choose `Shell` if the task consists of shell commands or choose `Container Image` in case of complex operations that require a specific container environment (refer ['Container Image' task](../creating-application/workflow/pre-post-tasks.md#example-3-container-image-task)).
    * **Input Variables** - Add one or more input variables to accept values from the user. Give a name to your input variable along with a description and input type (String/Number/Boolean/Date).
    * **Trigger Skip Condition** - Here you can set conditions to execute or skip the task. You can select **Set trigger conditions** to execute the task, or **Set skip conditions** to skip the task.
    * **Script** - Enter the script to be executed.
    * **Output directory path** - Enter the directory where your script will write/produce output files (e.g., test report, zip files).
    * **Output Variables** - Similar to input variables, you can create variables whose values will be generated as output after task execution.

    ![Figure 6: 'Execute Custom Task' Page](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/custom-task-page.jpg)
7.  Click **Update Pipeline**.

    ![Figure 7: 'Update Pipeline' Button](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/update-plugin.jpg)

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Next Steps

Go to the **Build & Deploy** tab of your application and run the pipeline having your custom task. If the custom task executes correctly and the script performs as expected, you may proceed to [save your custom task as a plugin](create-plugin.md#part-2-convert-custom-task-to-a-plugin).
{% endhint %}

***

### Part 2: Convert Custom Task to a Plugin

1.  Go to your custom task that you have tried and tested, and click **Save as Plugin**.

    ![Figure 8: 'Save as Plugin' Option](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/save-as-plugin.jpg)
2.  In the **New plugin** tab, fill the following details:

    | Fields                  | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
    | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Plugin Icon**         | Enter the online URL of your plugin icon (jpg/png supported). This image will be shown alongside your plugin name in the list of plugins.                        |
    | **Plugin display name** | Enter the name of your plugin, e.g., `Secret Management Validator`                                                                                               |
    | **Plugin ID**           | Enter a unique identifier for your plugin, e.g., `sec-mgmt-val`                                                                                                  |
    | **Plugin version**      | Enter the version of your plugin. We recommend using semantic versioning, e.g., `1.0.0`                                                                          |
    | **Documentation link**  | Give the user guide link for this plugin, e.g., `https://docs.devtron.ai/usage/plugins/plugin-list/jira-validator`                                               |
    | **Description**         | Enter a brief description of your plugin explaining what the plugin does                                                                                         |
    | **Tags**                | Select one or more tags from the list or create your own tag. This tag helps in identifying and classifying the plugin, e.g., `Compliance` `Secrets` `Security`. |

    ![Figure 8: Entering New Plugin Details](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/new-plugin-tab.jpg)
3.  You have the option of marking the input variables (defined in step 6 earlier) as mandatory/optional. Enabling the toggle will make the input variable mandatory for your users.

    ![Figure 9: Marking Variables as Mandatory or Optional](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/mandatory-optional.jpg)
4.  Since you created the plugin from a custom task, you get an option to replace the original task with your plugin (in the task list).

    ![Figure 10: Replace Task with Plugin](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/replace-with-plugin.jpg)
5.  Click **Create Plugin Version**.

    ![Figure 11: 'Create Plugin Version' Button](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/create-plugin-version.jpg)
6.  Your new plugin would appear in the list of plugins.

## Create a New Version of Plugin

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Who Can Perform This Action?

Only superadmins can create new versions of a plugin.
{% endhint %}

You may create incremental versions of your plugin (e.g., `1.0.0` â†’ `1.0.1` or `2.0.0`). The old version(s) of your plugins will still be available to your users.

1. Follow steps 1-7 from the [Create a New Plugin](create-plugin.md#create-a-new-plugin) section of this document.
2.  From the **New version of existing plugin** tab, select the plugin for which you want to create a new version from the **Existing Plugin** dropdown.

    ![Figure 13: Selecting Existing Plugin for Versioning](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/existing-plugin-select.jpg)
3.  Specify the new version in the **New version** field.

    ![Figure 14: Creating New Version](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/plugins/create-plugin/new-plugin-version.jpg)
4. Verify the details in the remaining fields that got auto-populated from your existing plugin and modify if required.
5. Click **Create Plugin Version**.
6.  You can view and use the available plugin versions as shown below.
